Natural Language Processing using Python. 

# Data Science Workflow

NLP is a sub-domain of Data Science, so, start with introduction to general workflow in Data Science:
1. Start with a Question
2. Get & Clean the Data
3. Perform EDA
4. Apply Techniques
5. Share Insights

# In this project we have done Exploratory Data Analyis, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modelling and Text Generation on data that is the transcripts of Various Comedians' acts.

The Jupyter Notebooks given above represent:
1. Collecting the data and cleaning the data : Transcripts are collected from scrapsfromteloft.com and data cleaning includes removing the articles, punctuations, prepostions and other stop words.
2. EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis includes making the corpus of the files and converting the data to document term matrix which will make it easier to process and apply various techniques on the data. If you want to skip this steps the files are already provided in the pre-created pkl files folder.
3. Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob library is used to analyse the sentiments of various comedians.
4. Topic Modelling: Gensim Library is used for topic modelling. LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) technique is used for topic modelling.
5. Text Generation: Text generation is done using Markov's chain process which is probabilistic approach.
